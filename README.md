CSE-6363-001-MACHINE LEARNING under Manfred Huber: Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Linear Regression and Softmax Regression


**Linear Regression:**
1. We delve into a fitting problem using periodic basis functions:
a) Implement a linear regression learner to solve the best fit problem for 1D data, accommodating different function depths (up to 6).
b) Apply the regression learner to the data generated in Question 1b. Plot the resulting functions for various function depths alongside data points.
c) Evaluate the regression functions using test data from Question 1c. Compare error results for different function depths, identifying overfitting tendencies and determining the optimal function depth.

**Locally Weighted Linear Regression:**
2. We explore locally weighted linear regression for addressing nonlinearity:
a) Implement a locally weighted linear regression learner for 1D data.
b) Apply the locally weighted linear regression learner to the data from Question 1b. Plot resulting functions with data points.
c) Evaluate the locally weighted linear regression on Test data from Question 1c. Compare performance with previous results.
d) Repeat the experiment and evaluation from part b and c, using only the first 20 elements of the training dataset. Compare performance and provide reasoning.
e) Considering parts c and d results, assess if the dataset aligns with the function format from Question 1.

**Softmax Regression:**
3. We revisit material prediction using Softmax regression:
a) Implement Softmax regression for classifying mug material based on height, diameter, weight, and hue features.
b) Evaluate Softmax regression performance through leave-one-out validation. Compare results with KNN and discuss differences in performance.
c) Repeat the evaluation and comparison from part b, this time excluding the fourth attribute. Present results and discuss differences in performance, considering potential reasons for one method's superiority.

In summary, we explore Linear Regression, Locally Weighted Linear Regression, and Softmax Regression for various prediction and classification tasks, applying different algorithms and evaluating their performance and implications.
